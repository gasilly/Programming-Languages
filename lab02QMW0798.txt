 CURRIED FUNCTION FOR GETTING MULTIPLES BY A CERTAIN FACTOR.HOW TO MAKE IT SO THE CURRIED FUNCTION CAN BE USED FOR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS OF FACTOR. SINCE FACTOR IS A CONSTANT IT CANT BE CHANGED AND THERE IS NO REUSEABILITY IN THIS CODE.

 // A curried function that takes two arguments
const multiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;

// A curried function that will be used with map
const multiplyBy = (fact) => (array) => array.map(multiply(fact));

// Example usage
const inputTable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const fiveTable = multiplyBy(5)(inputTable);
const thirteenTable = multiplyBy(13)(inputTable);
const squaresTable = multiplyBy()(inputTable); // <- NEEDS WORK
console.log("Five Table: ", fiveTable);
console.log("Thirteen Table: ", thirteenTable);
console.log("squaresTable: ", squaresTable);

const cylinder_volume = (r) => (h) => 3.14 * r * r * h;
console.log("cylinder_volume: ", cylinder_volume(5)(10));
console.log("cylinder_volume: ", cylinder_volume(5)(17));
console.log("cylinder_volume: ", cylinder_volume(5)(11));
